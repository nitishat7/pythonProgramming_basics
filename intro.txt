# Day 1
Python is an interpreted language. It was created by Guido van Rossum. It is open source and
has the concepts of object-oriented programming.
You do not need to compile your program before executing it,
and python is processed at runtime by the interpreter thus it is called an interpreted language.


#Day 2
operator in python:

-> Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/)
-> Assignment Operators (=,+=,/=)

#Day 3

Implicit type conversion
When data type conversion takes place during the run time or at compilation, it is called
implicit type conversion. Python supports implicit type conversion, thus we do not have to keep
on changing the data types , we can change it when required as shown in the example in file the
day3.py!!
